CLASSIFICATION OF HATE SPEECH AND OFFENSIVE TAMIL TEXTS USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

Social media has resulted in an exponential increase in the distribution of hostile and toxic content in today's world. Hate speech, inflammatory, and abusive language have recently piqued the interest of many in the Natural Language Processing community. In this paper, we suggest machine learning algorithms such as the Naive Bayes Multinomial model, KNN, Logistics Regression, and SVM to build models that automatically classify supplied posts as offensive or non-offensive. The suggested models make use of the dataset supplied for the Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification (HASOC) challenge in Dravidian Languages under FIRE 2021. The proposed machine learning-based offensive language identification algorithms are employed for Tamil in this work. KNN outperforms the other models, with an accuracy of 80.7%.
